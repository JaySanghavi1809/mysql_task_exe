find word " test"
->SELECT Stud_FName,Stud_MName,Stud_LName,Mobile_No FROM student WHERE CONCAT(Stud_FName, '', Stud_MName, '', Stud_LName) LIKE "%test%";

16. write a query for search given string or word to all fields and decide order accoring to find out list
    for example, given word found in 3 fields then its show first than same word found in 2 field than show in second

18.write a query for display first 5 student list which join date in given range
->SELECT S.Stud_FName,S.Stud_LName,S.Join_Date FROM student S WHERE Join_Date BETWEEN '2015-03-01 00:00:00' AND '2018-03-18 12:00:00';

SELECT * FROM student WHERE student.Join_Date BETWEEN '2015-01-01 00:00:00' AND '2018-09-18 12:00:00';

19. write a query for find out student details which have max percentage.

->SELECT s.`ID`, CONCAT(s.`Stud_FName`, ' ', s.`Stud_MName`, ' ', s.`Stud_LName` ) AS student_full_name, (SELECT SUM(Sub_Marks) FROM marksheet WHERE Student_ID = s.ID) AS total_marks, (SELECT SUM(Sub_Marks)*100/500 FROM marksheet WHERE Student_ID = s.ID) AS percentage, (SELECT IF((SUM(Sub_Marks)*100/500) >= 40, 'pass','fail') FROM marksheet WHERE Student_ID = s.ID) AS result FROM student s GROUP BY ID, percentage DESC LIMIT 0,2;

20,write a query for below output
student_id  total_student   result
1,2,5            3           pass
3,4              2          fail
->

SELECT 
GROUP_CONCAT(s.ID) AS "Student_ID" ,
 (SELECT IF((SUM(Sub_Marks)*100/500) >= 40, 'pass','fail') FROM marksheet WHERE Student_ID = s.ID) AS result,
 COUNT(*) AS "COUNT"
 FROM `student` s
  GROUP BY RESULT;
